Common Experience
=================

Following the success of [CK (Collective Knowledge) framework](https://github.com/ctuning/ck)
and based on the experience of using it (hence the name),
here we attempt to re-design certain assumptions central to the CK framework's kernel
which cannot be simply evolved from its current state
due to the requirement of code's backwards compatibility.

The goal here is to retain compatibility with the core ideas and the spirit of CK.
